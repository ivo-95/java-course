1. Java is a general-purpose computer programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented,[12] and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.
3. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of computer architecture.
5. Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which has since been acquired by Oracle Corporation) and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform.
7. The original and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary licences.
9. Others have also developed alternative implementations of these Sun technologies, such as the GNU Compiler for Java (bytecode compiler), GNU Classpath (standard libraries), and IcedTea-Web (browser plugin for applets).
